I am not very happy to see my network connectivity going down again and again but i can't do anything about it also. Again and again i have complained about the network connectivity but the company does not listen and again i have to suffer. When technician came again and repeatedly tried to solve the problem the network connectivity slightly improved. But mobile phone still acts weird as somehow they remember that mobile phones did not had network connectivity for so long. All hail mobile phones.
